# Sephora cosmetics
The data is taken from Sephora website containing all the brands and different categories of its selling products with close to 10000 items. The analysis has several intersting findings that look at the brand, price, categories belonged to the brand and ratings. 

## Assumption
The analysis assumes that rating is highly related to perceived quality by consumers meaning that the higher the ratings, the higher the quality of the brand. 

Reviewing the ratings using a histogram, the ratings concentrate on level four and five. To make a fine line what is perceived to be good quality, I assume that rating above 4 is perceived to be high rating and vice versa. 

## Finding one
Category VS Average rating
It is found that products recevie low ratings are not major skin products such as gift sets, fragrance. 

It is found that products receive high ratings are also not major skin products. Brushs, tools and high tech tools recieve the highest ratings. 

## Finding two
Brand VS number of category of each brand
It is found that the top five brands have the most categories are Sephora Collection, clnique, tarte, Tom Ford and Dior. For the remaining analysis, I would deeply look at how the top brands with more categories affect the ratings. 

It is found that for brand with more categories, the rating tends to decrease. The reason could be with more diversifed products, the brand could not focus more its effort to control the quality.

## Finding three
Sometimes we perceive that when we pay more money on beauty products, we have a higher quality of product. That might not be the case. I have plotted a correlation map between price and rating. There is a slim positive relationship between price and quality of products. 

## Finding four
By creating a heat map to further look into all the relationship between each element, it is found that the more people love a product(meaning they have more attention to the products clicking 'love' online), the more tendency people would write reviews on them.

However, the more people 'love' the products do not indicate they would like the products, it is found that the more people love the products, it tend to be unlikely for online products. The reason could be that people cannot really try on the online products and does that mean it is an indication for Sephora to evaluate if their AI or other virtual service such as virtual makeup works for consumers. 

All in all, in general consumers know what they love and choose their preferred brand, the ratings tend to go higher. It might be an insight for Sephora to motivate clients to love the products so they can get higher ratings and also more reviews on products,hence prompting transparency in information and popularity of the brand would thrive. 

## Finding five
I focus on analyzing the brands that recevie the most counts on high and low ratings. They are Sephora Collection, clnique, tarte, Fresh, Tom Ford, Dior, Lancome, Kiehl's Since 1851, Make up forever and Shiseido. 

It is intersting to find out that for the top five brands Sephora Collection, clnique, tarte, Fresh, Tom Ford. They receive most counts on high rating but have also a high portion of low rating except Fresh. Especially Sephora Collection, it has a high amount of low rating reviews. It go back to the nutshell to reflect, Sephora Collection has the most categories of producst and that might mean it has less control on the quality of products. 

## Final Thoughts
I think that beauty should be affordable to general public and that I also include the price elements when I look at the brands that receive ratings in finding five. We can see that Prices are the most affordable for Sephora Collection and that make sense. With a lower price in general together with mixed ratings, clients need to research more to see if the products would be good for them. It is suprsing to see that Tom Ford has the most expensive price but that does not mean that it receives good ratings counts compared to other brands. 

Lastly, I cannot wait to dive into deeper in my next analysis to see different categories and that might help us to go deeper to see how to choose products based on categories characteristics. 


##Limitation
I do not look into details for the highest amount of categories which are perfume, moisturizers, face serums, gift sts and face wash. I would look further into these categories in the future.
